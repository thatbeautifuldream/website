## Description

using git worktree to work on feature branch easily 

## readme.md

```markdown
# Git Worktree Cheat Sheet

## What is `git worktree`?
Allows you to work on multiple branches **in parallel** using **multiple working directories**.

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Go to your main repository

\`\`\`bash
cd ~/projects/your-main-repo
\`\`\`

### 2. Create and add a worktree for a branch

\`\`\`bash
git worktree add ../your-main-repo-feature-a feature-a
\`\`\`

- This creates a new folder: `../your-main-repo-feature-a`
- Checks out `feature-a` branch inside it
- Creates the branch if it doesn't already exist

### 3. Add another one

\`\`\`bash
git worktree add ../your-main-repo-feature-b feature-b
\`\`\`

Now you have:

- `your-main-repo/` (e.g. on main)
- `your-main-repo-feature-a/` (on feature-a)
- `your-main-repo-feature-b/` (on feature-b)

## Usage Tips

- Open each folder in a separate terminal or on your IDE window
- Work, commit, pull/push like usual in each
- No need to switch branches manually

## Cleanup

Remove a worktree:

\`\`\`bash
git worktree remove ../your-main-repo-feature-a
\`\`\`

## Delete the branch (optional):

\`\`\`bash
git branch -d feature-a
\`\`\`

## List active worktrees

\`\`\`bash
git worktree list
\`\`\`

## Full Flow

\`\`\`bash
# Main repo
cd ~/projects/my-repo

# Create worktree for feature-a
git worktree add ../my-repo-feature-a feature-a

# Create worktree for feature-b
git worktree add ../my-repo-feature-b feature-b

# List all active worktrees
git worktree list
\`\`\`

```
