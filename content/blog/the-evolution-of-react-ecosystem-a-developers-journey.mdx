When I first started with React, the landscape was vastly different from what we have today. React was already a game-changer, but the tools and best practices were constantly evolving. Over the years, I’ve seen major shifts—from **Create React App (CRA) to Next.js, class components to hooks, Redux to Zustand, and React Router to TanStack Router.** Each phase brought challenges, excitement, and a lot of learning.

This blog is a reflection of my journey through the evolving React ecosystem and how modern React apps are built today.

## The Early Days: Create React App & The React Router Struggles

Back in my early days, **Create React App (CRA)** was the go-to tool for bootstrapping a React project. It provided a simple setup with Webpack and Babel pre-configured, making it easy for beginners to dive in. I still remember my first React app, where I used:

* **Material UI** for styling
    
* **React Router v6** for navigation
    
* **Redux** for state management
    

React Router v5 was the standard, but then came **React Router v5** with a completely new API. I vividly recall the migration struggles—routes had to be restructured, and breaking changes forced us to rethink navigation strategies. Documented them [here](https://milind.hashnode.dev/react-router-v6-basics-migration-guide-from-v5).

At the same time, managing state with Redux was a norm, but it came with **boilerplate-heavy actions, reducers, and store configurations.** Even for a simple counter app, you had to write multiple files! Still, at that time, Redux was the best choice for global state management.

## The Next.js Era: Embracing Server-Side Rendering

As React applications grew, **performance and SEO** became critical. Enter **Next.js.** My transition from CRA to Next.js felt like moving from a tiny apartment to a fully furnished house.

With Next.js, I could:

* **Use server-side rendering (SSR)** with `getServerSideProps`
    
* **Generate static pages (SSG)** with `getStaticProps`
    
* **Leverage API routes** for backend functionalities
    

These features were game-changers. I remember working on client’s SEO-heavy project where SSR drastically improved our rankings for thier real estate marketing. The idea of fetching data server-side before rendering felt revolutionary at the time.

## The Evolution: From Pages Router to App Router

For years, Next.js relied on the **Pages Router**, where each `.jsx` or `.tsx` file inside the `pages/` directory automatically became a route. It was simple and effective. Need a new page? Just add a new file inside `pages/`, and it worked like magic.

However, this approach had limitations:

* **Data fetching was explicit** (`getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, `getInitialProps`)
    
* **Mixing API routes and frontend logic felt disconnected**
    
* **Routing wasn’t as flexible** (deep nested routes required workarounds) and a layout convention was not really available
    

### **The App Router Mental Model**

With improvements in Next.js 13+, the **App Router** introduced a more **intuitive mental model**:

* **Each folder inside the** `app/` directory represents a route
    
* **A** `page.tsx` file defines the frontend component of that route
    
* **A** `route.ts` file inside an `api/` subfolder defines the backend route for that page
    

## The Rise of Modern Ecosystem Tools

Beyond Next.js, the React ecosystem has been evolving at an incredible pace. Some of the most notable shifts I’ve experienced include:

### 1\. **React Query & The Death of Global State for Data Fetching**

Earlier, Redux was used for everything—including async data fetching. But then **React Query (TanStack Query) came along and changed the game.**

With React Query, I no longer had to manually handle caching, re-fetching, loading states or managing Infinite Queries. It felt like magic. Today, I can’t imagine building a React app without it.

### 2\. **From Redux to Lighter State Management**

For years, Redux was the default choice, but with time, developers sought **simpler alternatives** like:

* **Zustand** (lightweight and minimal)
    
* **Jotai** (atomic state management)
    
* **XState** (state machines)
    

I remember a project where Redux felt like overkill, so I switched to Zustand, and suddenly, managing state became effortless. No actions, no reducers—just a simple store and hooks.

### 3\. **React Router vs. TanStack Router**

When setting up frontend apps without frameworks React Router has always been a staple, but recently, **TanStack Router** has emerged as a strong competitor with the goodness of typed routes and when combining the power of Query it becomes really powerfull as a client side routing solution. It provides **better type safety, parallel routes, and data-aware navigation.** I’m excited to see how these routing libraries in React evolves further.

### 4\. **The Fall of CSS-in-JS & The Rise of Tailwind**

A few years ago, **CSS-in-JS solutions like Styled Components and Emotion were the go-to choices.** I used them extensively, but they had drawbacks—runtime performance issues and large bundle sizes.

Then **Tailwind CSS** came along. Initially, I was skeptical about writing classes like `text-gray-500` instead of CSS, but once I got the hang of it, the benefits were undeniable. **Faster styling, better DX, and lower CSS bloat.** And introduction to headless UI libraries like Headless UI, Radix UI, React Aria Components have started becomming the norm. And [shadcn ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) becoming increasingly promising with its reusable copy paste components!

## The Present & Future of React

Looking at React today, it’s clear we’ve come a long way:

* **React Server Components are the new norm**
    
* **Next.js is becoming the default meta-framework**
    
* **State management is now lightweight and modular**
    
* **The ecosystem is shifting towards performance and developer experience**
    

As I reflect on my journey, I realize how exciting it is to be a React developer. The ecosystem is constantly evolving, and there’s always something new to learn. **The best part? React’s core philosophy remains the same—building powerful UIs with components.**

What’s next for React? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: it’s an exciting time to be a React developer.
