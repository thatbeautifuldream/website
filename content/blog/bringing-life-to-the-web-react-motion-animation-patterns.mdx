Web animations have become a cornerstone of creating engaging and intuitive user experiences. They breathe life into your interfaces, guide users through interactions, and elevate the overall appeal of your application. In this guide, weâ€™ll explore the most common and highly useful animation practices in React using Framer Motion, a declarative library admired for its versatility and performance.

## **Why Framer Motion?**

Framer Motion simplifies animations in React. It empowers developers to create both simple transitions and complex gesture-driven interactions with minimal effort. Key features include:

- Declarative syntax for animation.
- Motion components for seamless integration.
- Support for gestures like hover, tap, and drag.
- Advanced orchestration with layout transitions, variants, and keyframes.

## Add the code examples and play with the sandbox

<CodeSandbox sandboxId="95qmhd" title="motion-animations" />

Letâ€™s dive into some animation practices every developer should master which are already implemented in the sandbox.

## **1\. Hover Animations**

Hover animations provide visual feedback, indicating interactive elements. They enhance user experience and draw attention to crucial components.

### **Example: Scaling on Hover**

Using the `whileHover` property, you can add an animation when a user hovers over an element.

```typescript
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

const HoverButton = () => (
  <motion.button
    whileHover={{ scale: 1.1, backgroundColor: "#F25C05" }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
  >
    Hover me!
  </motion.button>
);
```

The result is a smooth scale-up effect when the user points to the button.

## **2\. Tap Animations**

Tap animations provide feedback for actions like button clicks. They assure users that their interaction has been registered.

### **Example: Scaling on Tap**

```typescript
const TapButton = () => (
  <motion.button
    whileTap={{ scale: 0.9, rotate: 10 }}
    transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 300 }}
  >
    Tap me!
  </motion.button>
);
```

## **3\. List Animations**

When displaying a series of items, animating their entrance and exit can create a polished, professional feel. Framer Motionâ€™s `AnimatePresence` makes this seamless.

### **Example: Staggered List Animation**

```typescript
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

const list = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const containerVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.2 },
  },
};

const itemVariants = {
  hidden: { x: -50, opacity: 0 },
  visible: { x: 0, opacity: 1 },
};

const ListComponent = () => (
  <motion.div initial="hidden" animate="visible" variants={containerVariants}>
    {list.map((item) => (
      <motion.div key={item} variants={itemVariants}>
        List Item {item}
      </motion.div>
    ))}
  </motion.div>
);
```

## **4\. Page Layout Animations**

Layout animations ensure smooth transitions when elements or pages appear/disappear. Framer Motion handles layout changes intelligently with `layout` and `AnimatePresence`.

### **Example: Layout Change Animation**

```typescript
const ExpandingCard = ({ isExpanded, toggle }) => (
  <motion.div
    layout
    className={isExpanded ? "expanded" : "collapsed"}
    onClick={toggle}
  >
    Click to {isExpanded ? "Collapse" : "Expand"}
  </motion.div>
);
```

Framer Motion automatically animates the resizing of the card.

### **Page Transitions with AnimatePresence**

```typescript
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from "framer-motion";

const PageTransition = ({ children, isVisible }) => (
  <AnimatePresence>
    {isVisible && (
      <motion.div
        initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
        animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
        exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
      >
        {children}
      </motion.div>
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>
);
```

This ensures smooth transitions as components enter or leave the DOM.

## **Advanced Practices**

Now letâ€™s step into advanced territory. Hereâ€™s how to push Framer Motionâ€™s capabilities even further.

### **A. Variants for Orchestrations**

Variants let you define multiple animation states and share them across components.

```typescript
const parentVariant = {
  show: { scale: 1 },
  hide: { scale: 0 },
};

const circleVariant = {
  show: { opacity: 1 },
  hide: { opacity: 0 },
};
```

### **B. Drag-and-Drop Animations**

Enable users to move components interactively.

```typescript
<motion.div drag dragConstraints={{ top: 0, left: 0, right: 100, bottom: 100 }}>
  Drag Me
</motion.div>
```

## **Conclusion**

Animating on the web is an art and Framer Motion is your brush. Armed with these patterns, youâ€™ll create delightful, engaging experiences while keeping your code clean and scalable. Start experimenting today and elevate your React UI to a whole new level of polish.

Happy animating! ðŸŽ¨
