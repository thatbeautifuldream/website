Working with two Git profiles on the same machine might sound straightforward, but it can quickly turn into a frustrating experience. I faced this challenge when trying to maintain separate mac os profiles for personal and work projects. Here’s why maintining in the same profile was necessary for me and how I managed to resolve the issues.

## The Pain of getting the permissions mixed between Profiles

As a developer juggling personal side projects and professional work, I found myself constantly switching between the tow user profiles. This led to several issue of **Mixed Permissions** I used to work on the different profile for work and personal projects, and used to struggle resetting permissions for brew, node and other binaries. These challenges forced me to find a better solution to manage multiple Git profiles on my machine.

## Setting Up Two Git Profiles

To solve this, I set up separate SSH keys and configurations for each profile. Here’s how you can do it too:

### 1\. Create SSH Keys for Each Account

Generate separate SSH keys for your personal and work accounts and add them to respective [github accounts](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) :

For macOS and Linux:

```bash
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email_for_personal_account@example.com" -f "github-personal"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email_for_work_account@example.com" -f "github-work"
```

### 2\. Add SSH Keys to the SSH Agent

Add the generated keys to your SSH agent:

For macOS:

```bash
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/github-personal
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/github-work
```

Fir Linux:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/github-personal
ssh-add ~/.ssh/github-work
```

### 3\. Configure SSH for Multiple Accounts

Edit the SSH config file to define host aliases for each account:  
`nano ~/.ssh/config`

```bash
# Personal account
Host github-personal
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github-personal

# Work account
Host github-work
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github-work
```

4\. Use Correct Accounts for Repositories

When cloning repositories, use the appropriate host alias:

* For personal projects:  
    `git clone git@github-personal:username/repo.git`
    
* For work projects:  
    `git clone git@github-work:username/repo.git`
