### **1\. Getting Started: Create and Invite Your Team**

Once you start a project in Merlin, you can quickly invite teammates to join:

- **Invite Members**: Use the “Share” button in the project header.
  - Enter email address.
  - Assign roles: **Editor,** or **Viewer**.

### **2\. Project Visibility: Choose Who Sees Your Work**

Merlin offers flexible visibility states for every project:

- **Private (Default)**: Only you, the owner, can access the project. Not discoverable unless shared.
- **Shared**: Extend access to specific people through invitations. Perfect for teamwork, clients, or select groups.
- **Public**: Make your project discoverable on the web. Anyone with the link can see—showcase research progress or resources to the world.

Transition easily between these states as your needs change. Moving from private to shared or public is just a click away, and you can always restrict access again if needed.

### **3\. Show Off Your Work: Project Publishing & Public Demos**

Ready for the world to see what you’ve built? Publishing turns your project into a live, interactive project chat page.

- **Customize your public page**: Generate prompt suggestions and reading content.
- **Interactive Shared Chat Experiences**: Visitors can read content and chat with your project knowledge.

You always have the option to unpublish or tweak what’s visible to the public.

### **In Conclusion**

With Merlin’s project sharing and collaboration tools, teams can move faster, learn from each other, and easily showcase results. Whether you’re building in private, collaborating with trusted peers, Merlin helps you get the best out of this shared knowledge and chat experience.
