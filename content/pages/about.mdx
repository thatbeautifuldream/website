![About Banner](/about-banner.png)

I'm a Product Engineer based in Bengaluru, India, passionate about building impactful AI, SaaS, and platform products. I love taking products from zero-to-one, whether it's architecting decentralized protocols like [Proof-of-Skill](https://proofofskill.org), building AI-powered tools like the [AI Roadmap Generator](https://airoadmapgenerator.com), or shipping features for millions of users at companies like Merlin AI.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me creating educational content, speaking at meetups, or exploring new technologies. I share my journey and insights on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/milindmishra), connect with the dev community on [X](https://x.com/milindmishra_), and showcase my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/thatbeautifuldream).

I'm particularly excited about the intersection of AI and user experience, having worked on everything from conversational interfaces to real-time applications. My recent projects have reached thousands of users and include tools that help developers visualize data, generate learning roadmaps, and discover side projects.
