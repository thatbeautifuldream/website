I'm particularly excited about the intersection of AI and user experience, having worked on everything from conversational interfaces to real-time applications. My recent projects have reached thousands of users and include tools that help developers visualize data, generate learning roadmaps, and discover side projects.

## Talks

I love sharing knowledge and connecting with the developer community through talks at meetups and conferences.
