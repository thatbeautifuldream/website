![About Banner](/about-banner.png)

Namaste üôèüèª! I'm a Product Engineer based in Bengaluru, India, passionate about building impactful SaaS and platform products. I love taking products from zero-to-one and elevating products from one-to-hundred.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me creating educational content, speaking at meetups, or exploring new technologies. I share my journey and insights on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/milindmishra), connect with the dev community on [X](https://x.com/milindmishra_), and showcase my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/thatbeautifuldream).

I'm particularly excited about the intersection of AI and user experience, having worked on everything from conversational interfaces to real-time applications. My recent projects have reached thousands of users and include tools that help developers visualize data, generate learning roadmaps, and discover side projects.
