Hey, I'm **Milind**. I build software that doesn't make people want to throw their laptop out the window.

Right now I'm at **[Foyer](https://foyer.work)**, working on **Merlin AI**, you know, that thing **2 million people** use to chat with AI models. I spend my days figuring out how to make AI interfaces feel less like talking to a robot and more like, well, not that. Turns out people really appreciate when things **load instantly** and don't make them wait for a spinning wheel.

Before this, I bounced around building things: hiring platforms that tried to make recruitment less biased, IoT positioning systems that could tell you where things are in a factory (accurate to **under 10cm**, which is apparently impressive), and a bunch of early-stage startup chaos where "move fast" was less of a motto and more of a survival strategy.

On the side, I make tools I wish existed. Like **[AI Roadmap Generator](https://airoadmapgenerator.com)**. Over **5,000 people** have used it to figure out what to learn next, which is wild considering I built it because I was bored one weekend. Or **[JSON Visualiser](https://jsonvisualiser.com)**, where an average dev opens it up to **49 times**. I don't know who you are, but I appreciate you.

I also contribute to **[Vercel's open source stuff](https://github.com/vercel)**, give talks at React meetups about animations and AI (yes, I'm that person who gets excited about **view transitions**), and occasionally write about things I'm figuring out.

If you want to chat about product, React, or why performance matters more than people think, I'm on **[X](https://x.com/milindmishra_)** and **[GitHub](https://github.com/thatbeautifuldream)**. Or just **[book some time](https://cal.com/milind)**. I promise I'm less formal than this website suggests.
