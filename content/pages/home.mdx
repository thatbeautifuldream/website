I'm an ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Product Engineer living in Bengaluru, Karnataka. I love creating beautiful software that delights users and reimagines the way we interact with technology. I'm passionate about building impactful AI, SaaS, and platform products, with a proven track record of taking ideas from zero-to-one.

I'm currently at Merlin AI by Foyer, where I focus on driving product engineering initiatives for next-gen AI chat experiences. I've shipped features that serve millions of users, from ChatGPT import tools to enhanced model selectors that boost adoption by 80%. After hours, I'm exploring AI-native applications, building open source projects, and sharing knowledge through talks and technical writing.

I'm most active on [X](https://x.com/milindmishra_) and [GitHub](https://github.com/thatbeautifuldream) if you want to chat or see what I'm building. You can also find me speaking at React meetups or creating tools like the [AI Roadmap Generator](https://airoadmapgenerator.com) that help thousands of developers learn and grow.
