I'm currently a Product Engineer at [Merlin AI by Foyer](https://getmerlin.in), where I'm driving product engineering initiatives focused on seamless AI integration and next-gen chat experiences. I've shipped features like ChatGPT Imports UI for 10,000+ users, launched project-based chat history pages that increased session retention by 15%, and revamped the Model Selector boosting adoption by 80%.

Before joining Merlin AI, I was a Software Engineer at [SARAL - The Influencer OS](https://getsaral.com), where I built core features and internal tools that improved efficiency and decision-making for influencer campaigns. I delivered a revamped dashboard that reduced onboarding time by 30% and engineered multi-select drag-and-drop features that increased ops efficiency by 40%.

Prior to that, I was the Founding Product Engineer at [Proof-of-Skill Protocol](https://proofofskill.org), where I developed UI flows and we launched a decentralized skill validation protocol revolutionizing unbiased, transparent candidate evaluation for tech hiring. I led MVP development, designed voting-based consensus flows for 150+ validators, and built proctored assessment workflows that cut time-to-interview by 50%.

Earlier in my career, I worked as a Research Assistant at [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/) in Taiwan, where I built and optimized indoor positioning system interfaces for cutting-edge IoT research. I enhanced UWB positioning accuracy from 20cm to under 10cm and enabled 3D real-time visualization for production-ready factories and research labs.

I also spent time as a Software Engineer at [Locus Connect](https://www.locusconnect.com/) in Taiwan, developing core 3D visualization and internal infrastructure tools for proprietary IoT positioning solutions. I produced frontends for 3D positioning platforms and maintained internal services achieving 99.9% uptime.

I've had the pleasure of working with various organizations in different capacities - as a UX Designer at [iNeuron.ai](https://www.ineuron.ai/) where I designed intuitive user experiences and managed design systems, and as a Technical Writer at [Plusklass](https://www.plusklass.com/) where I authored technical content for learning modules.

I've also been fortunate to work on a freelance basis, delivering AI-powered products for hiring and skills validation, building recruiter analytics platforms, and engineering AI-powered quiz systems with modern tech stacks[^1].
